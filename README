SWIPE' pitch estimator, v. 1.3

Based on Camacho, Arturo. A sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator for
speech and music. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida. 2007.

Implemented in C by Kyle Gorman <kgorman@ling.upenn.edu>

HOW TO CITE:

Please cite this dissertation, and if possible include a URL to this program
source, the most-recent version of which will always be at:

    http://ling.upenn.edu/~kgorman/c/swipe/

HOW TO INSTALL:

For all platforms: To compile, type "make" at the terminal. To install, type 
"make install" at the terminal. You may specify '--prefix=PATH/TO/LOCATION' if
you wish; the default is /usr/local
  
Linux: All the large libraries should be available as packages if you're using 
a "modern" distro. For instance, on a current Debian/Ubuntu system (Ubuntu 
9.04, "Jaunty Jackalope", kernel 2.6.28-13-generic), I ran (as superuser):

apt-get install liblibblas-dev liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev libsndfile1-dev

This installed the necessary libraries and all their dependencies.

Mac OS X: The linear algebra libraries ([C]LAPACK, BLAS) ship with Mac OS X.
You will need to install the newest versions of fftw3 and libsndfile, however. 
They are available for free online:

http://www.fftw.org/
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

If you are superuser and wish to install globally the autoconf method should 
work fine:

tar -xvzf downloadedPackage.tar.gz
cd folderOfPackageCreatedByUnTARring/
./configure; make; make install;

If you're not superuser, or don't want to install globally, make sure to use 
'--prefix=PATH/TO/LOCATION' as an argument to 'configure'. You may need to 
alter the #include statements as well.

These two libraries are also available via fink or DarwinPorts.

Windows/CYGWIN: Unsupported. Send details of any successes, however.

AUDIO FILE FORMATS:

All mono-channel audio recognized by libsndfile is accepted. For a list, see:

MISCELLANY:

I also included the original MATLAB code from Camacho as swipe.m.
