Based on Camacho, Arturo. A sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator for
speech and music. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida. 2007.

Implemented in C by Kyle Gorman <kgorman@ling.upenn.edu>

HOW TO CITE:

Please cite this dissertation, and if possible include a URL to this program
source, the most-recent version of which will always be at:

    http://ling.upenn.edu/~kgorman/c/swipe/

HOW TO INSTALL:

Read the included INSTALL file

AUDIO FILE FORMATS:

All mono-channel audio recognized by libsndfile is accepted. For a list, see:

    http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features

MISCELLANY:

A Python wrapper, swipe.py, is also included. See it for some sample usage. If you are processing a lot of files, it may make more sense to simply run it in batch mode. I also included the original MATLAB code from Camacho as swipe.m.
